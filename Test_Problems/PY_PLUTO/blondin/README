The test problems in this directory are examples of blondin type runs.

They are currently:

small_ratio_grid: An attempt to reproduce the small blondin run in 
	http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...836...42H. This also acts
	as an example of the `new' ratio grid type that is not documented
	in the pluto user manual.
	
	It is of the form    X1-grid 1 r_inner 80    r    r_outer r_ratio
	
	where r_inner and r_outer are the inner and outer coordinate - in code units
	r_ratio is the ratio of the n+1th grid cell to the nth cell.
	
large_log_grid: This is a large model, like the large bloding run in
	the above paper. It uses the more usual log grid - as detailed
	in the pluto user guide.
	
	
The 'non standard' inputs in the pluto.ini files are as follows. All should
be in cgs units/


RHO_0                The midplane density at R_0  
RHO_ALPHA            The exponent of the midplane density - 2 makes xi constant  
R_0                  The radius at which rho_0 is set - normally R_IC
CENT_MASS            The mass of the central object
DISK_MDOT            The disk accretion rate - used only to set up the initial temperature profile  
CISO                 The isothermal sound speed - not used in ideal gas simulations like these
L_x                  The central source luminosity above 13.6eV
T_x                  The xray temperature of the assumed bremsstrahlung source
DISK_TRUNC_RAD       The radius at which the central boundary mass drops off - edge of the disk
